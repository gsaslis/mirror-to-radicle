# Mirror to Radicle

A GitHub Action that mirrors your code to the peer-to-peer Radicle code hosting
network, where Open Source Software can thrive beyond corporate agendas and
constraints.

## Why?

In case you have been feeling more and more uncomfortable with the idea that all
the world's Open Source Software is being
hosted on a single platform, there is now an alternative!

The [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz) peer-to-peer network now allows you to host
your code in a decentralized manner, with
universal discoverability. For more details about Radicle, you can check out the
various [Guides](https://radicle.xyz/guides).

Start mirroring your code to Radicle!  âœŠ

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> Before using this action in your repo, to continuously
> mirror your code to Radicle, you have to do a one-time setup of creating
> the Radicle repository where the code will be mirrored *to*.

Here is the bird's eye view:

1. Install Radicle CLI on your machine,
1. Create your Radicle identity,
1. Publish your project on Radicle,
1. Set up _machine account_ for continuous mirroring
1. Use this GitHub Action on your project

Here goes:

### 1. Install `rad` Command Line Interface tool.

Visit [this page](https://radicle.xyz/guides/user#installation) for
other installation instructions.

```shell
curl -sSf https://radicle.xyz/install | sh
```

### 2. Create your Radicle Identity

Feel free to skip this step if you have previously created one.

```shell
rad auth
```

Once you fill in the details, the output should look like this:

```shell
$ rad auth

Initializing your radicle ðŸ‘¾ identity

âœ“ Enter your alias: yorgos
âœ“ Enter a passphrase: ********
âœ“ Creating your Ed25519 keypair...
âœ“ Adding your radicle key to ssh-agent...
âœ“ Your Radicle DID is did:key:z6MkrnXJWPndzPBxpBUaE3L3BnMeWpaQdT1V1FvkoCPFSFS3. This identifies your device. Run `rad self` to show it at all times.
âœ“ You're all set.
...
```

#### (Optionally) Publish your Radicle Identity on GitHub

One way to make your new identity known to your network is to publish it
on GitHub. If your connections trust your GitHub profile, they will know
they can trust this new identity as well.

Edit your "Social Profiles" section on GitHub to add a link to your
newly-created identity:

- run `rad self --did` and use the output in place of `$your_did_key` below
- Enter the following URL:
  `https://app.radicle.xyz/seeds/seed.radicle.garden/users/$your_did_key`

This will add a an `<a rel="me">` link on your github.com/$username page,
allowing everyone to _verify_ this is indeed your own key.

This is one way that you can tell your contacts that when they see
commits signed by your key in the Radicle network, it's really you.

_Of course, this implies trust in Microsoft / GitHub._

### 3. Publish your project on Radicle !

In order to publish your project to Radicle, you'll need to start a Radicle
node on your machine, so that it can let other nodes in the network know
about your project.

```shell
# first, check whether you've already started your node
$ rad node status

# now, go ahead and start it! Don't worry, you can stop it later 
# with `rad node stop` 
$ rad node start 
```

For more details on starting your node, see the
[User Guide](https://radicle.xyz/guides/user#operate-nodes-smoothly).

Once your node is running, and it has connected to other nodes, you can go
ahead and announce your project!

> [!TIP]
> **A Note on _Keeping_ your project online:** One of the nice
> things with Radicle is that peers can run nodes with a _permissive_
[policy](https://radicle.xyz/guides/seeder#a-permissive-seeding-policy), to
> help support the health of the network and the overall availability of
> Open Source Software (OSS) to the world at large.
> As long as a single permissive node exists on the network, you
> can rest assured that your project will be available to everyone else on the
> network. The more permissive nodes there are, the greater the resilience and
> availability of your project will be.

If you don't want / can't rely on permissive nodes, you can also [run your own
seed node](https://radicle.xyz/guides/seeder#running-your-node) to ensure
your project remains seeded.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/gsaslis/mirror-to-radicle
$ cd mirror-to-radicle 
$ rad init

Initializing radicle ðŸ‘¾ repository in <redacted>/projects/mirror-to-radicle..

âœ“ Repository successfully synced to 4 node(s).

```

### 4. Set up _machine account_ for continuous mirroring

**Machine Account creation**

The next step, now that your project is already part of the Radicle network,
is to create another identity that can push to this project, on your behalf.

In Radicle, all code is signed by a private key. When you push your code to
GitHub, your commits may or may not be signed by a private key. However,
for them to be pushed to Radicle, they must be signed by a Radicle identity.

You already created a Radicle identity to publish your project. At the time
of writing this, all identities on Radicle are meant to be used on a
single-device at a time. (There is a lot of work happening to improve this in
the future). For this reason, you should keep the keys of the identity
you created on your laptop/desktop alone.

Because this GitHub action will be running somewhere other than your laptop,
you need to create a 2nd Radicle identity, to be used essentially as
a _machine account_ by GitHub Actions.

To create this new identity, you'll just need to define a new folder where
its data will be stored. We use `~/.radicle_actions` in the example below.

```shell
$ export RAD_HOME=~/.radicle_actions
$ rad auth

Initializing your radicle ðŸ‘¾ identity

âœ“ Enter your alias: yorgos_actions
âœ“ Enter a passphrase: ********
âœ“ Creating your Ed25519 keypair...
âœ“ Adding your radicle key to ssh-agent...
âœ“ Your Radicle DID is did:key:z6MkqewxVQjPk8cSNJWxjYGmwZSu8tk1cwnb3Z8mQzXNMxnF. This identifies your device. Run `rad self` to show it at all times.
âœ“ You're all set.

To create a Radicle repository, run `rad init` from a Git repository with at least one commit.
To clone a repository, run `rad clone <rid>`. For example, `rad clone rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5` clones the Radicle 'heartwood' repository.
To get a list of all commands, run `rad`.
```

Now go ahead and seed and fork the project from the machine account, so you
can authorize it in the next step:

```shell
$ export RAD_HOME=~/.radicle_actions
rad seed rad:z3pN2URJoxrZSrnwKoYtWrgfS8qLL
rad fork rad:z3pN2URJoxrZSrnwKoYtWrgfS8qLL
```

**Machine Account authorization**

As the last setup step, it is time to authorize the _machine account_ you
created to sign and mirror your code from GitHub -> Radicle.

In Radicle, the users who have permissions on a project are called
`delegates`. To add your machine account as a delegate of the project you
created, you need a couple more bash commands:

```shell
# Need to act as the original author of the project (so we switch RAD_HOME) 
export RAD_HOME=~/.radicle
rad id update \
  --title "Add machine account" \
  --description "Adds machine account used by GitHub Actions for continuous mirroring" \
  --delegate did:key:z6MkqewxVQjPk8cSNJWxjYGmwZSu8tk1cwnb3Z8mQzXNMxnF \
  --threshold 1
rad sync 
```

You are now ready to set up this GitHub action! See next section below

### 5. Add this GitHub Action to your repo

Once the setup above has been completed, you will have all the necessary
information to set up this GitHub Action
on your repo and start mirroring to Radicle.

#### Add the necessary secrets

If you plan on mirroring multiple repositories to Radicle, it is best if you set
up the Radicle identity you created
as the GitHub Actions machine account
under [Environment Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-deployments/managing-environments-for-deployment#environment-secrets),
after creating a new Environment (e.g. `radicle`).

You can then configure each mirrored project to re-use this environment by going
to `https://github.com/$github_user_or_org/$project/settings/environments` and
setting the environment there.

Within this environment, you will need to create 4 secrets:

- `RADICLE_IDENTITY_ALIAS`: the alias you used when creating the GitHub Actions
  machine account. In the example above,
  this was `yorgos_actions`.
- `RADICLE_IDENTITY_PASSPHRASE`: the passphrase you used to protect the private
  key of the GitHub Actions machine account.
- `RADICLE_IDENTITY_PRIVATE_KEY`: the **base64-encoded format** of the private
  key of the GitHub Actions machine account. You
  can get this with, e.g. `cat ~/.radicle_actions/keys/radicle | base64`
- `RADICLE_IDENTITY_PUBLIC_KEY`: the **base64-encoded format** of the public key
  of the GitHub Actions machine account. You
  can get this with, e.g. `cat ~/.radicle_actions/keys/radicle.pub | base64`

<img src="/assets/github_environment_with_secrets.png" alt="Prefer Environment secrets, so you can reuse your machine account on other projects" width="400">


Once those are set up, head on over to your project's Actions Secrets and create
the remaining 2 secrets:

- `RADICLE_PROJECT_NAME`: the project name you assigned to this project when you
  ran `rad init`,
- `RADICLE_REPOSITORY_ID`: the repository id that you got after you created.

<img src="/assets/github_project_actions_secrets.png" alt="The Secrets on your project settings" width="400">

#### Add the GitHub Actions workflow

As the final step, you'll need to create a new workflow in `.github/workflows/`

```yaml
name: Mirror to Radicle

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  push:

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:

      - id: mirror
        uses: gsaslis/mirror-to-radicle@v0.1.0
        with:
          radicle-identity-alias: "${{ secrets.RADICLE_IDENTITY_ALIAS }}"
          radicle-identity-passphrase: "${{ secrets.RADICLE_IDENTITY_PASSPHRASE }}"
          radicle-identity-private-key: "${{ secrets.RADICLE_IDENTITY_PRIVATE_KEY }}"
          radicle-identity-public-key: "${{ secrets.RADICLE_IDENTITY_PUBLIC_KEY }}"
          radicle-project-name: "${{ secrets.RADICLE_PROJECT_NAME }}"
          radicle-repository-id: "${{ secrets.RADICLE_REPOSITORY_ID }}"
```

### Verify it worked

After the job has run successfully, you can try visiting:
https://app.radicle.xyz/seeds/ash.radicle.garden/$radicle-repository-id to
browse your repository on Radicle!

`ash.radicle.garden` is just one of the permissive nodes seeding content to
support the Radicle network. Please
feel free to consider
